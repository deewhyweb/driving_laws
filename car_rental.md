The Parasol Insurance car rental policy is as follows:

Parasol will pay the daily rental charge incurred when an insured rents a car from a car business while your car or newly acquired car is not driveable or being repaired as a result of loss which would be payeable under comprehensive coverage.

Parasol will pay this daily rental charge during the period that starts on the date the vehicle is not driveable as a result of the loss or the vehicle is left at a repair facility if the vehicle is driveable.

Payment for car rental from Parasol insurance will end on the earliest of the date the vehicle has been repaired or replaced, the date Parasol insurance offers to pay for the loss of the vehicle if you choose to delay repairs, or seven days after Parasol insurance offers to pay for the loss if the vehicle is stolen and not recovered.

The amount of the car rental must be reported to Parasol insutance before we will pay such an amount.
